# London Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Problem
The goal of this project is to analyze London Airbnb listings to understand price distribution, location trends, and relationships between features.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- location (borough)
- price (nightly price)
- rooms (number of rooms)

Missing values were present and handled during preprocessing.

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. Data loading using Pandas
2. Data cleaning (missing value removal)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
5. Correlation analysis

## 📈 Key Insights
- Westminster has the highest average price.
- Hackney has lower average prices.
- There are visible price outliers.
- Number of rooms positively correlates with price.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Apply machine learning model for price prediction
- Add more features (reviews, availability)
